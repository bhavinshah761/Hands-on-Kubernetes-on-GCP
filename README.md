# Hands-on-Kubernetes-on-GCP

Kubernetes is a one of the most popular container-orchestration systems available. Created by Google, Kubernetes is a highly-scalable platform that allows the production and implementation of microservices architecture within an app. Also, Kubernetes is cloud-agnostic, and can operate within any cloud provider. Comprised of nodes, the "Master" node handles API calls, controls the production of Kuberntes "pods", and contains the "etcd"; which acts a database to store all cluster data. The "Master" node sanctions all "Worker" nodes or "Kubelets".
